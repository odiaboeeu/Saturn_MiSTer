## Overview

The Saturn was a 32-bit console by Sega, released in 1994 in Japan and 1995 in North America and Europe. Sega designed its Saturn with advanced hardware and with dual CPUs, making it difficult for programmers. In addition, components were not specifically created to work together, graphics hardware was complex, and the system's basic geometric primitive was based on quadrilaterals which proved difficult for Sega because the rest of the industry based its design on triangles. Eventually, the Saturn was eclipsed by the release of Sega's own Dreamcast.

## Technical specifications

- **CPU**: 2x Hitachi SH2 32-bit RISC CPUs @ 28.63 MHz
- **RAM**: 16Mbit SDRAM
- **VRAM**: 12Mbit SDRAM
- **Graphics**:
  - Sega/Hitachi VDP1 @ 28.63 MHz (sprite/texture and polygons)
  - Sega/Yamaha VDP2 @ 28.63 MHz (background, scroll and 3D)
- **Resolution**: 320x224 to 704x224, 16,777,216 millions colors
- **Sound CPU**: Motorola 68EC000 @ 11.3 MHz
- **Sound Processor**: Yamaha SCSP (Saturn Custom Sound Processor) YMF292 @ 22.6 MHz
- **Media**: CD-ROM

## Hardware Requirements

- 128 MB SDRAM Module (Primary)
- SDRAM Module of any size (32MB-128MB) (Secondary)

> **Note:** Dual SDRAM modules is recommended for better compatibility.

## Test Builds

Test builds can be downloaded from the GitHub Actions, they are automatic generated on push against the current code of the repository and should not be considered releases.

To download select a workflow bellow, click on the most recent run and download the zip file under `Artifacts produced during runtime`.

- [Single SDRAM](https://github.com/srg320/Saturn_MiSTer/actions/workflows/test-build.yml)
- [Dual SDRAM](https://github.com/srg320/Saturn_MiSTer/actions/workflows/test-build_ds.yml)

> **Note:** Actions has a 90-day retention rule by default, after that the artifacts are not available anymore.

### Keys F1-F11 enable/disable the video screens/audio channels:

## Building

### Prerequisites

To build this project you also need the following repositories [Saturn](https://github.com/srg320/Saturn) and [SH](https://github.com/srg320/SH)

### Cloning the Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srg320/Saturn_MiSTer.git
git clone https://github.com/srg320/Saturn.git
git clone https://github.com/srg320/SH.git
```

The repositories must be on the same level:

```bash
.
├── SH
├── Saturn
└── Saturn_MiSTer
```

### Project Files

Inside the folder `Saturn_MiSTer` you will find 2 Quartus project files.

- `Saturn.qpf` - Build project for usage with Single SDRAM.
- `Saturn_SD.qpf` - Build project for usage with Dual SDRAM (**recommended**).

> **Note:** For both builds the primary SDRAM module must be 128MB (i.e. with two chips)!

## Compatible BIOS

> **BIOS NOT INCLUDED:** In order to use this core, you need to provide your own BIOS.

Rename your Saturn bios file to `boot.rom` and place it in the `games/Saturn/` folder.
